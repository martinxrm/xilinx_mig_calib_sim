About this example:
  This example is to show user the development process for simulating the calibration of DDR4-MIG.
  just launch set_sim.sh bash script to create the MIG and start the simulation. It might stop when the calibration is done.
  It has been tested with Questasim 2020.1 and Vivado 2020.1
  Simulation of the Calibration of the MIG is a long simulation.
  The code can be re-used without any restrictions.


Pre Requirement:
 - Modelsim Or QuestaSim shall be installed on your machine
 - Vivado and SDK installed
 - The following Xilinx compilation has been previously compiled for Modelsim/QuestaSim
   * microblaze_v10_0_5 
   * lib_cdc_v1_0_2 
   * proc_sys_reset_v5_0_12 
   * lmb_v10_v3_0_9 
   * lmb_bram_if_cntlr_v4_0_14 
   * blk_mem_gen_v8_4_1 
   * iomodule_v3_1_3 
   * unisims_ver mig7_dram.glbl 
   * unimacro_ver 
   * secureip 
   * xpm 

Note:
 1- Adapt paths in script
  * vivado install path: /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2020.1/bin/vivado
    -> modify scripts/compile_ddr4_mig_dram.sh and to adapt your path
    -> modify compile_ddr4_mig_dram.do (set include_dir5)
  * modelsim.ini path for xilinx libraries: /share/Xilinx_lib/Vivado/2020.1/Mentor/Questa2020.1/modelsim.ini
    -> modify sim/modelsim/modelsim.ini to adapt your path
 2- To get accurate timescale during calibration, set ACCURATE_SIM to 1 in sim/modelsim/run_sim.tcl. It will slow down simulation.
